# Signs and Markings Projects

Here's a rundown of all the Notebooks I have done in relation to the Signs and Markings division for business operations. Most of the coding projects has been put on hold since summer 2020 due to migration to Microsoft PowerBI for reporting and ArcGIS Pro for automatic work order creation thanks to public GIS layers.
